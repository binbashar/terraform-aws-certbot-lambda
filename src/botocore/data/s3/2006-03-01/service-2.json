These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.</p> </dd> <dt>Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) \u2013 If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side\u200b-encryption</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side-encryption-context</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>If you specify <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms</code>, but don't provide <code>x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id</code>, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.</p> </note> <important> <p>All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.</p> </important> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use customer-provided encryption keys \u2013 If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side\u200b-encryption\u200b-customer-algorithm</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side\u200b-encryption\u200b-customer-key</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-server-side\u200b-encryption\u200b-customer-key-MD5</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html\">Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </dd> <dt>Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers</dt> <dd> <p>You also can use the following access control\u2013related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Using ACLs</a>. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL (<code>x-amz-acl</code>) \u2014 Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly \u2014 To explicitly grant access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:</p> <ul> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-read-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-write-acp</p> </li> <li> <p>x-amz-grant-full-control</p> </li> </ul> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> \u2013 if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code> \u2013 if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> \u2013 if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> header grants the AWS accounts identified by email addresses permissions to read object data and its metadata:</p> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress=\"xyz@amazon.com\", emailAddress=\"abc@amazon.com\" </code> </p> </li> </ul> </dd> </dl> <p>The following operations are related to <code>CreateMultipartUpload</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>UploadPart</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>CompleteMultipartUpload</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>AbortMultipartUpload</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListParts</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListMultipartUploads</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this operation provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.</p> <p>The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete operation and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.</p> <p> The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete operation encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the operation does not return any information about the delete in the response body.</p> <p>When performing this operation on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html#MultiFactorAuthenticationDelete\"> MFA Delete</a>.</p> <p>Finally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests.

The response headers that you can override for the GET response are <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>, <code>Expires</code>, <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Content-Disposition</code>, and <code>Content-Encoding</code>. To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.</p> <note> <p>You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters.

Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-acl</code>. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission.

The Standard storage class provides high durability and high availability. You can specify other storage classes depending on the performance needs. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-class-intro.html\">Storage Classes</a> in the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.</p> <p> <b>Versioning</b> </p> <p>If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response using the <code>x-amz-version-id response</code> header. If versioning is suspended, Amazon S3 always uses null as the version ID for the object stored. For more information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see <a>GetBucketVersioning</a>. If you enable versioning for a bucket, when Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.</p> <p class=\"title\"> <b>Related Resources</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CopyObject</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteObject</a> </p> </li> </ul>",

Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-ac</code>l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> \u2013 if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code> \u2013 if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> \u2013 if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> </ul> <p>For example, the following <code>x-amz-grant-read</code> header grants list objects permission to the two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.</p> <p> <code>x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress=\"xyz@amazon.com\", emailAddress=\"abc@amazon.com\" </code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly.

To access an archived object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored from. </p> <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being restored from and which data access tier you specify. </p> <p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1\u20135 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier\u2019s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html\">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing another restore request to the same object, setting a new <code>Tier</code> request element. When issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters, such as the <code>Days</code> request element. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html\"> Upgrading the Speed of an In-Progress Restore</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p> <p>To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html\">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p> <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days.

For example:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Same object quality prefix-based filter criteria if prefixes you specified in multiple rules overlap </p> </li> <li> <p>Same object qualify tag-based filter criteria specified in multiple rules</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see <a href=\" https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html\">Replication</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p>",
